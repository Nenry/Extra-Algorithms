// For this problem, your goal is to sort an array of 0, 1 and 2 's but you must do this in place, 
// in linear time and without any extra space (such as creating an extra array). 
// This is called the Dutch national flag sorting problem. 
// For example, if the input array is [2,0,0,1,2,1] 
// then your program should output [0,0,1,1,2,2] and the algorithm should run in O(n) time.
