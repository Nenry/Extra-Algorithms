// Anagrams
// Find mininmal amount of deletions until they are complete anagrams of each other
// they are just purely lowercase lettrs
//punctuations or anything special?
//edge cases?
//duplicates?

//psuedo solutions 
//1. Hash/set one string of all its letter// improvement hash both. 2N // while hashing can keep count of letter length
//2. Check each letter of the longest string 
//3. forEach(letter) (deleteCount += Math.abs(hash1[letter] - hash2[letter])
//4. return count
